# Contributing

Thanks for being willing to contribute!

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this _free_
series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][egghead]

## Project setup

1.  Fork and clone the repo
2.  Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
3.  Checkout the development branch, which contains the latest changes
4.  Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b pr/your-branch-name`

> Tip: Keep your `dev` branch pointing at the original repository and make pull
> requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/Provincie-Zuid-Holland/Omgevingsbeleid-Frontend.git
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/dev dev
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," Then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `dev` branch
> to use the upstream dev branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you can make
> all of your pull request branches based on this `dev` branch. Whenever you
> want to update your version of `dev`, do a regular `git pull`.
